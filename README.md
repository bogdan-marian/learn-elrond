## Complex data structures and pem files (from scratch part3)
This clip explains how to deal with relatively more complex data structures. 
- define the data structures
- persist them in the storage
- pack data in lists as part of the smart contract response.  
- abi files
- consume data from the client-side using erdjs

Hello wonderful community. Time to learn about how to deploy contracts at scale. If you consider this type of content valuable pleas share and like. Love you all ❤️

## run snippets

```bash
# build java
cd e02-crowdfunding-api
./gradlew build
cd ..
# set env project id (very useful if you deploy on google cloud)
export PROJECT_ID=my-sand-box
docker build -t gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/crowdfunding:v1 .
docker run -p 8080:8080 gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/crowdfunding:v1
docker run -it gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/crowdfunding:v1 /bin/bash

## question: How to deploy a contract from React

Is possible to use the web wallet to sign also deployment transactions?

I'm still struggling with figuring out how to deploy a contract using React.
The examples from here in case of the web wallet to not cover this particular use case.
https://github.com/ElrondNetwork/elrond-sdk/blob/development/erdjs/src/smartcontracts/smartContract.dev.net.spec.ts

- In React web in order to read a binary file and not be modified on deploy you place the file in the `/public` folder. (I still do not know how to do this with react native)
- The provide tests only show how to load the wasm code and deploy the contract using the "fs" library. The fs library is not available in the browser so I have loaded the contract by using the web and hard coding temporary the contract served by the '/public' folder.
- What I get in response from testnet-wallet.elrond.com is a `413 (Request Entity Too large)

The request url
https://testnet-wallet.elrond.com/hook/transaction?receiver=erd1qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq6gq4hu&value=0&gasLimit=3000000&gasPrice=1000000000&data=0061736d0100000001601160047f7f7f7f0060027f7f017f600 etc etc ..... @0100&callbackUrl=http://localhost:3000/deploy

This is the current commit that shows what I tried to do. https://github.com/bogdan-marian/learn-elrond/commit/cc47f03cfa67dfc9267da4c04e2630cf38f35e30

If you want to test the project ans checkout I'm trying to do

```
git clone git@github.com:bogdan-marian/learn-elrond.git
git@github.com:bogdan-marian/learn-elrond.git
git checkout 003-question-deploy-smart-contrac
yarn install
yarn start
# Open Test-Net Wallet
# Deploy new contract
# Deploy contract
# You get the 413 Error
```

Thank you for any feedback.

## Learn to code for Elrond (part 2)

- [ ] add close wallet button
- [ ] add denominate components
- [ ] add contract code
- [ ] check the contract balance
- [ ] check using test-net that all works
  - [ ] something was wrong with ALICE

## Learn to code for Elrond (part 1)

- setup workspace:
  - use setup workspace command
  - use crowd funding template
  - run the
  - use the react template: https://github.com/ElrondNetwork/starter-dapp

## the hard part (hacking our way through)

I have some notes for create react app but that is it.

## log and snippets

### setting up a new react project

```bash
npx create-react-app e02-crowdfunding-web-app
```

What to remove

- App.css
- index.css
- logo
- App.test.js
  From App.js
- Just live a single div
  From index.js
- remove idex.css reference

Better theam

- Add chakra-ui
- customize theme
- dark theme

```javascript
const theme = extendTHeme({
  config: {
    initialColorMode: "dark",
  },
});
```
